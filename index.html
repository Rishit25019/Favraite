    <h2> About </h2>
    <p>The Score is an American alternative rock band formed in New York City in 2015. The group consists of Eddie Anthony Ramirez (vocals, guitar) and Edan Chai Dover (keyboard, producer). They were signed to Republic Records in 2015 after their song "Oh My Love" was featured in an advertising campaign for Asda supermarkets.The Score gained recognition in early 2015, when the British supermarket chain Asda (owned by Walmart) used their track "Oh My Love" in a major advertising campaign titled "Save Money, Live Better". According to Asda, part of the reason why they selected the song was because "they were unsigned and unknown".[2]

The song's placement in the advertisement helped The Score rise in the public eye, and "Oh My Love" reached number 43 on the UK Singles Chart in July 2015. That same year, the track became the most-detected song from an advertisement by the Shazam music identification service. The song also appeared in the 2015 film Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip.

Following the success of "Oh My Love", The Score signed a record deal with Republic Records. They released their debut extended play, Where Do You Run, in September 2015. A song from that EP, "On and On", was featured in the spring programming line-up for HBO.After announcing on social media that a new EP would be released, The Score officially released the Unstoppable EP on September 23, 2016. The title track was later featured in the 2017 Power Rangers film. In 2017, "Unstoppable" was also used as the theme song for the World Series of Poker (WSOP) main event, streamed live on ESPN2 and Poker Central beginning on July 8. In 2018, the song was used in advertising campaigns for the Jeep Grand Cherokee. Unstoppable was also used in one of Dude Perfect's videos titled "Water Bottle Flip Edition Dude Perfect" released on July 18, 2016.</p>
